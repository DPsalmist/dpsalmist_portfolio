### About
The one thing I'm passionate about as much as programming is teaching it.
 
Hi! I am a software developer with over four (4) years of experience, a mentor, and an educator that thrives on helping others while learning from them about their various needs to achieve their goals. I started my teaching journey just immediately after secondary school (2010). From initially being on trial (due to my age) to being a full-time class teacher, I have grown and found passion over the years in my professional journey with over seven (7) years of experience as an educator. The desire to be a software developer led me to a software development boot camp where I learned core skills in web development and SDLC processes. I have since been a freelancer providing solutions to businesses and individuals via my web development skills. My educational journey proceeded to a master's degree in Computer Science with a Ph.D. in mind. Over time, I found a beautiful crossover between education and tech which has led me to be what I am now i.e. a software developer, AI researcher, and a tech facilitator/educator.

### Projects

1. # [Regression Analytics Using California Dataset](https://github.com/DPsalmist/data_analytics_project)

### Description
This project shows a regression analysis under supervised machine learning. The aim was to predict the prices of the houses in California using the Sklearn California dataset.

### Objectives
1. To evaluate the performance of the support vector regressor (SVR) for the prediction
2. To predict the prices of the houses in unseen data
3. To do this and that

### Technology Used
The following technologies are used for this project:
  1. Anaconda
  2. Python
  3. Pandas
  4. SKlearn
  5. NumPy
  6. Matplotlib
