### About
The one thing I'm passionate about as much as programming is teaching it.
 
Hi! I am a software developer with over four (4) years of experience, a mentor, and an educator that thrives on helping others while learning from them about their various needs to achieve their goals. I started my teaching journey just immediately after secondary school (2010). From initially being on trial (due to my age) to being a full-time class teacher, I have grown and found passion over the years in my professional journey with over seven (7) years of experience as an educator. The desire to be a software developer led me to a software development boot camp where I learned core skills in web development and SDLC processes. I have since been a freelancer providing solutions to businesses and individuals via my web development skills. My educational journey proceeded to a master's degree in Computer Science with a Ph.D. in mind. Over time, I found a beautiful crossover between education and tech which has led me to be what I am now i.e. a software developer, AI researcher, and a tech facilitator/educator.
